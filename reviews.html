         <h4>"We were worried about storms"</h4>
         <p>We were entering the fall months and realized that our trees had many low
         hanging and dead branches. We were worried about storms through the winter that
         may cause the branches to fall out of the trees. A few of the branches were hanging over
         our house and could have caused damage. 417 Lawn Salon was so quick to get us and came and
         trimmed all of our tree. They even took the branches with them so we wouldn't have to
         dispose of them. We're so thankful for 417 Lawn Salon! We now feel like we can survive the winter!</p>

         <h4>"Our lawn was a mess"</h4>
         <p>We had just bought a new house and the previous owners had clearly not worried about
            the look of their lawn. Our lawn was a mess and it was embarrassing to have people look at it.
            417 Lawn Salon came to our rescue and completely redesigned out yard! They were able to design and
            lanscape in just one week! We wouldn't trust anyone else with making our yard look so amazing!</p>
