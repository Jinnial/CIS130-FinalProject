      <h1>417 Lawn Salon</h1>
      <p>The 417 Lawn Salon is a family owned business that has been run by three different generations.
         The company was created by Grandpa Bill as a summer project for him and his son. Bill never
         forsaw the ability for his favorite hobby to become a business but that's what happened. Before he
         knew it 417 Lawn Salon became a full time job and a healthy growing business.</p>
      <p>Many people wonder where our name comes from. Grandma Julie used to tease Bill about he created
         a job out of giving people's yards haircuts. This teasing soon created the beloved name the 417
         Lawn Salon.</p>
